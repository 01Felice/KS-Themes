# Simple KlipperScreen Themes

Since the original themes were a little bit too playful for me, I have created new themes, there are three colour variations.

To install, copy the three folders into the klipperScreen/styles folder, I using winSCP, for example, then restart KipperScreen and select the new theme via “More” and “KlipperScreen”.

**Many thanks of others for the works, this style uses in part the styles colourized & material darker by Alfredo Monclus and MoistDreams for the Icons.**
